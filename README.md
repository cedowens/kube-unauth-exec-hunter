# Phishing Difficulty Scoring Tool

This is a simple python3 script that allows teams to run their internal phishing email exercises through a scoring model to determine the phishing difficulty.

The script presents a series of questions and then scores the difficulty based on the answers selected.

If you disagree with the ranges or point levels, feel free to edit them to your liking.

This can be helpful when reporting on internal phishing exercise metrics to help put those metrics in the context of perceived difficulty level.

Once complete, the script writes the results to a file in the current directory for archiving/reference.
